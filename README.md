 Humans can integrate information from multiple cues in different ways to make a
 decision. Real-world cues are often related by some underlying aggregation func
tion that maps cues to outcomes. Humans must thus implicitly learn to approximate
 this latent, multivariate aggregation function in order to make decisions. Hence we
 refer to this function heretofore as the decision function. Decision functions may
 also be simple or complex. How well are artificial neural networks(ANNs) able
 to approximate a latent decision function as the task complexity increases? We
 investigate this fundamental question in this project using an empirical simulation
 where cues are represented by binary classification data generated according to a
 f
 ixed but hidden decision function and the agent is a feed forward neural network
 that must learn to approximate this function in order to take the right action. We
 vary various hyper-parameters of the data and model in an attempt to find any
 scaling laws that could govern the learning of this task by ANNs
